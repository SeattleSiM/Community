    Severity of Violations:
Minor Violations: These typically include non-malicious, one-time remarks or behaviors that are inappropriate but not threatening. Examples might include insensitive comments, minor disruptions, or spreading unverified rumors or discussing unreported behaviors with others instead of using official channels.
Moderate Violations: Repeated minor violations or single instances of more serious misconduct fall into this category. This can include persistent unwelcome comments, unwarranted photography or sharing of personal information without consent, or disruptive behavior that impacts the event or individuals. Also includes repeatedly spreading unconfirmed reports about others, which can create a hostile environment or harm the reputation of individuals.
Major Violations: These are severe and often involve potential harm to individuals or the community. Examples include harassment, threats, physical violence, or other behaviors that create a hostile environment.
Critical Violations: Immediate threats to safety or illegal activities, such as sexual assault, use of weapons, or severe harassment. These require the most urgent and decisive action.
