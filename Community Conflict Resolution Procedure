Assessing Incident Severity:

- When encountering or witnessing a conflict that does not violate the Code of Conduct, start by assessing the nature of the incident:
  - Informal Resolution: Minor disagreements or misunderstandings that can potentially be resolved informally among the parties involved without formal mediation.
  - Formal Mediation Required: More significant disputes that disrupt community harmony or involve repeated minor disagreements that have not been resolved informally.
- For Code of Conduct Violations: Please refer directly to our "Reporting and Enforcement Procedures" document. It is crucial to report these incidents through the official channels outlined there to ensure they are handled appropriately.


Steps We Take Upon Receiving a Report:

Initial Assessment:
- A designated staff member reviews the situation to determine if the conflict requires formal mediation.
- If further information is needed, the staff member may contact the reporter or the involved parties.

Assignment of a Mediator:
- A neutral mediator from within the community will be assigned, agreed upon by all parties involved, to ensure fairness and understanding of the situation.

Scheduling a Mediation Session:
- A session is arranged to provide a structured environment for the parties to discuss their issues under the guidance of the mediator.
- Mediation Process:
  - Setting the Stage: The mediator sets the ground rules for respectful and focused communication, ensuring equal speaking opportunities.
  - Sharing Perspectives: Each party shares their view uninterrupted, with the mediator clarifying and deepening understanding as needed.
  - Identifying Common Ground and Differences: The mediator summarizes key points, finding common interests and areas of disagreement.
  - Exploring Solutions: Parties brainstorm potential solutions, guided by the mediator to think constructively.
  - Negotiating Agreements: The mediator aids in negotiating a mutually acceptable resolution, making adjustments as necessary.
  - Finalizing the Agreement: All parties formally acknowledge the agreed terms, typically in writing.
  - Closure: The session concludes with a summary of agreements and discussion of any necessary follow-up actions.

Agreement and Documentation:
  - Any resolutions reached are formally documented, and all parties involved sign to affirm their commitment to the terms decided upon during mediation.

Follow-Up:
  - The effectiveness of the resolution is monitored as agreed, with follow-ups to ensure that the resolution is adhered to by all parties.

Closure:
  - The process is formally concluded once the agreed-upon actions have been implemented successfully, and the issue is fully resolved.
